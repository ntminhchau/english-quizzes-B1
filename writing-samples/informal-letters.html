A friend from another town will come and stay in your apartment...</p></div><div class="letter-body"><p>Dear Sarah,<br><br>I hope this letter finds you well. I'm just writing to tell you a few things you'll need to know before coming to stay at my place.<br><br>First, about getting in. The remote for the main gate is in a small bag hidden under the tree on your right as you face the house. Press it once to open and again to close. For the second door, you'll need to input a password, which is 999999 – quite easy to remember!<br><br>A few things about the house: you can open the windows without keys, but please shut them if you go out as it might rain. There's some food and drinks in the fridge for you to use. If it gets warm, the remote for the air conditioner is on the wall beside the fridge. Also, if you have a moment, could you please water the plants and feed the fish for me? I'd really appreciate it.<br><br>Finally, there are some great places you should visit. If you like swimming or seeing the sunrise, Vung Tau and Ho Tram beaches are fantastic. Also, don't forget to check out that restaurant I told you about, 'Corona Restaurant', which is located in Phu Quoc city centre.<br><br>Enjoy your stay!<br><br>All the best,<br>Lai</p></div></section>

Xin lỗi vì lỡ sinh nhật bạn</h3><div class="letter-prompt"><p>One of your friends recently had a birthday celebration, but you missed it and you forgot to tell your friend that you couldn't attend...</p></div><div class="letter-body"><p>Dear Sarah,<br><br>I hope you’re well and that you had a fantastic time on your birthday. I’m so sorry that I wasn’t there to celebrate with you, and for not letting you know in advance that I couldn't come. I feel terrible that I haven’t found the time to contact you until now.<br><br>The truth is, I had to go on an unexpected overseas business trip with my boss for two weeks, right around your birthday. I couldn't refuse because it was very important for my career. I was working from early in the morning until late at night, so I haven't been able to think about much else recently. This is why I missed your party and didn't call to tell you.<br><br>I really hope you’ll forgive me for being so thoughtless, and I hope you’ll let me make it up to you. As an apology, I’ve bought you a birthday present and booked a table at a Korean restaurant for us for dinner next Saturday. I hope you’ll come.<br><br>Hope to see you then!<br><br>All the best,<br>Lai</p></div></section>

Hỏi xin lại ảnh chụp chung</h3><div class="letter-prompt"><p>You recently went on a trip with a friend and you both took some photographs...</p></div><div class="letter-body"><p>Dear Sarah,<br><br>I hope you enjoyed our trip last week. I'm writing to ask if you could send me a copy of the photo you took of the sun setting over the mountains. I remember you took some of me with the sunset in the background, but I hope you have one that just shows the beautiful scenery.<br><br>The reason I need that photo is that I think it would look great as the background on my laptop. The main reason is I'd love to have it as a daily reminder of those memorable moments. I also haven't uploaded any new photos to Facebook or Instagram in a while, and it's always fun when Facebook shows the memories each year.<br><br>I remember taking some similar photos, but I can't find them anywhere. I think my memory card might be corrupted, as there is only one picture left on my camera. It would be great if you could email a copy to me if you still have it.<br><br>Hope to hear from you soon!<br><br>All the best,<br>Lai</p></div></section>

I’m just writing to ask for your help with something.<br><br>I’ve been thinking about studying abroad for a while now, and I’ve decided I want to study marketing in Australia. I’d love to study in Melbourne, especially since I know you are there.<br><br>As you know, I got a degree in accounting, but I didn't enjoy it very much. I’m quite good at communication and foreign languages, and I've been doing an academic English course for a while now to prepare for studying overseas.<br><br>However, the problem is that I don't know which university to apply to. I'd be really grateful if you could give me some advice and send me some information about different colleges there. I'm curious about the tuition fees, living costs, the weather, and the culture. Also, could you please find out what qualifications I need?<br><br>I hope you don't mind me asking. It's much better to get this information from someone who actually lives in the country.<br><br>I hope to hear from you soon.<br><br>Many thanks,<br>Lai</p></div></section>
        <section id="letter7"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-rose-400">7. Muốn bán lại xe đạp cho bạn</h3><div class="letter-prompt"><p>You want to sell your bicycle. You think a friend of yours might like to buy it from you...</p></div><div class="letter-body"><p>Dear Sarah,<br><br>I hope this letter finds you well. I'm just writing to ask if you might be interested in buying my bicycle.<br><br>As you know, my house is quite small and I have two bicycles but seldom use this one. So, I've decided to sell it because I don't have enough space to keep it.<br><br>It's a Giant mountain bike that I bought 4 years ago. It's green and black and has a fashionable style suitable for all roads. The body is made of aluminium, so it's quite light. I love it, but I have no choice since there's no place to put it.<br><br>Why don't you come around and have a look sometime? You can even test-drive it before deciding. I'm usually out during the day, so just give me a call to let me know before you arrive. How about this weekend?<br><br>Hope to see you soon!<br><br>All the best,<br>Lai</p></div></section>

            <div class="letter-prompt"><p>You want to sell your television. You think a friend of yours might like to buy it from you...</p></div>
            <div class="letter-body">
                <p>Dear Sarah,</p><br>
                <p>I hope this letter finds you well. I'm writing to ask if you might be interested in buying my television.</p><br>
                <p>As you may know, my family is moving to Canada next year, so I've decided to sell the TV as it's too big and difficult to take with us.</p><br>
                <p>It's a 65-inch 4K Sony TV that I bought 4 years ago for $3000. With its widescreen and 4K resolution, you don't have to worry about the image quality when watching football or movies. In addition, it has a 3D sound system and a very nice, thin design. I'm hoping to sell it for around $500.</p><br>
                <p>Why don't you come over and have a look sometime? I’m sure you won't be disappointed. A few people have already messaged me about it, but I wanted to offer it to you first. I'm usually at work from 8am to 5pm on weekdays. If you are interested, give me a call when you get this letter.</p><br>
                <p>I hope to hear from you soon.</p><br>

            <div class="letter-body">
                <p>Dear Sarah,</p><br>
                <p>I hope this letter finds you well. I’m just writing to thank you for the present which I received yesterday. It's been a while, but you still remembered my birthday!</p><br>
                <p>Honestly, I was so surprised when I opened it. I don't know how you knew exactly what I wished for! It's an iPhone 15 Pro Max, the most expensive gift I've ever received. I couldn't wait and unboxed it immediately to start experiencing its new features. It looks so nice and luxurious. I felt like I was dreaming, but it's real!</p><br>
                <p>I've already spent all day using it to listen to music, play games, and watch my favourite films. It's also very convenient for me to learn English anywhere, especially when I'm on the bus. This present is very meaningful to me, and I promise I'm going to study English hard.</p><br>
                <p>Thank you again for your amazing present.</p><br>
                <p>All the best,<br>Lai</p>

I was so excited when you invited me to visit your country! I'm just writing to ask for some information about my trip.<br><br>I have never been to another country before, so I’m really excited. I would like to bring a present for you and your family, but I’m not sure what would be suitable. Could you tell me what your mother's favourite things are?<br><br>I’m also wondering what the weather will be like. Will it be cold when I come? What kind of clothes should I bring? Also, what kinds of activities are popular there, and should I bring trainers or swimming gear?<br><br>Finally, could you tell me about the traditional food? I’m a big fan of food, so I’d love to try some local dishes.

My house has a spare room where you are welcome to stay during your holiday. Alternatively, you could stay at a homestay near the city centre that my friend opened about 3 years ago.
